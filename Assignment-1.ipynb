    "Values: These can be literal values, such as numbers (integers or floats) or strings, or they can be variables that represent values. For example, 42 or \"Hello, World!\" are values in expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: Variables are names that represent values. You can use variables in expressions to refer to the values they store. For example, if you have x = 10, you can use x as a variable in an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators: Operators are special symbols or keywords that indicate what operation to perform on the values or variables. Examples of operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions: In Python, functions can also be part of expressions. Functions take arguments and return values. For example, len(\"Hello\") is an expression that uses the len function to calculate the length of the string \"Hello.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of expressions in Python is to produce a value. When you evaluate an expression, it results in a single value. This value can be used in various ways, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment: You can assign the value of an expression to a variable.\n",
    "Comparison: You can compare the value of an expression to other values.\n",
    "Printing: You can print the value of an expression to the console.\n",
